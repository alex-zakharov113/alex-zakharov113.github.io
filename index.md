### About me

I have over 3 years of experience as a php developer for magento platform. During this time I have worked with projects of various sizes (more than 30 projects). In the beginning I worked as a fullstack developer, but later my role shifted to the backend. Mostly my job was to support stores, and rarely it was additions to the functionality in accordance with the requirements of the business.

At the moment I want to make my knowledge deeper and increase my programming skills. I think this will allow me to move from support to development. At the same time I want to try a new technology such as .net. It would be very interesting for me to work on projects with a full development cycle in a team under the guidance of an experienced team lead.

### Highlights

Participated in over 30 projects.

### My interests

- Workout and gym. I like the fresh air, but I also like working with weights.
